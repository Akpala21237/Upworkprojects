The purpose of the game is to avoid stepping out of the way. It's a game of coordination eye-hand.

The game screen will be a a moving road viewed from above.

The player is represented by a dot (representing in turn a car) that moves only in horizontal each time the player clicks a button on the keyboard.

The final game will consist in 2 screens (left-right) with the same layout, but with different movements of the road, with the purpose of making it a challenge to maintain both dots in the middle of the road.

The game will finish at a certain point, and then the game over screen will show the percentage (%) of time that the player stepped out of the way from the start to the end, for both hands separately and altogether as well.
